## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92610726?s=48&v=4)

Serenity is a robust and flexible Minecraft server framework built with TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions for building Minecraft servers, allowing developers to focus on creating unique gameplay experiences without worrying about the underlying network and protocol details.

Key features of Serenity include:

Event-Driven Architecture: Serenity uses an event-driven model, making it easy to react to various game events such as player joining, leaving, or spawning.
Network Abstraction: Serenity provides a high-level network abstraction, simplifying the process of sending and receiving packets.
Extensibility: Serenity is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to easily add new features or modify existing ones.
Debugging Support: Serenity includes built-in debugging support, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues.
Serenity is part of a larger project that also includes a RakNet server implementation and a Bedrock protocol parser. Together, these tools provide everything you need to create custom Minecraft servers.
